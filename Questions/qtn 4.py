#Question 4(i)

# Add two more items to the list.
# Remove one item from the list.
# Print the updated list.

#Initial list
# favorite_food = ["Pizza","Sausage","Matooke","Dry Chicken","Fish"]
# print("initial favorite foods:")
# print(favorite_food)

#  #removing one item
# favorite_food.remove("Matooke")
# print("\nupdated favorite food with one item remove" )
# print(favorite_food)


#Question 4(ii)
# Given the list numbers = [2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6], write a Python program to:
# Print the first and last elements of the list.
# Print the list in reverse order.
# Calculate and print the sum of all the elements in the list.

numbers = [2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]
print("The first elements of the list is;")
print(numbers[0])


print("The last elements of the list is;")
print(numbers[-1])

print("The reverse order of the list is written below;")
print(numbers[::-1])
